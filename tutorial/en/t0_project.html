            Choose New from the main menu and create a new project<br>
            (If you already have the project open, you will get a discard dialog)
            When you are ready to create a new one, choose Save and save it with a file name of your choice (with the .sbd extension)<br>
            <br><br>
            On the left side of the window are the components of the game, such as sprites and sounds.
            The categories on the right side of the window are for narrowing down the list of parts as they become available.
            <br><br>
            Next we will actually create the parts needed for the game in sequence
