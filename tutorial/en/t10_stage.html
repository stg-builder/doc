            Keep the project file created in the previous tutorial open<br>
            <br> <br>
            There are two types of parts that can be placed on the stage: characters and formation<br>
            <br> <br>
            There are two methods, time alignment and coordinate alignment, depending on the application<br>
            If you want the enemy to appear against the background, you can use coordinate placement<br>

            Open the previously created 'STAGE1' and select the enemy placement tab<br>

            You can delete a placed character by selecting a range of icons and then clicking the delete button<br>
