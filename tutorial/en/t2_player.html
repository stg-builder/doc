            <h1>2. Create a player</h1>
            Create your own machine (player) for human operation<br>
            It is also possible to create multiple players and have them selected at the beginning of the game<br>
            <br> <br>
            There are three parts required for a player: the player, the character, and the script<br>
            We will start by creating a character<br>
            Keep the project file created in the previous tutorial open<br>

            <h2>Create a character for the player</h2>
            Click on the project's character and press the New button to create the character<br>
            Double-click the created character to open it and name it 'TYPE-A'<br>

            Type... My Machine
            Attribute flags... Check as shown in the figure to the right<br>
            Parameters... Leave it all at 0<br>
            Sprite... Add the previously created sprite 'MYSHIP' by pressing the Add button<br>

            <br> <br>
            Script will be added later, so we don't need it this time<br>
            Adding the script will cause it to disappear when your plane is destroyed<br>
            Also, there is no need to touch any tabs other than the main tab<br>

            500<br> in the normal column of the movement speed settings
            Enter the pattern number for each of the pattern settings<br>
            <br> <br>
            Change the pattern number depending on the direction of movement<br>
            Check the pattern number to open the sprite edit<br>

            Click Add Player List to add the player 'TYPE-A' that you just created<br>

            The player appears at the bottom of the screen, with the cursor keys or joypad<br>
            If you can move it up, down, left and right, you're done!
