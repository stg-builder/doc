    How to create a menu

    Register a stage（Option -> Game setting -> Scene）
    Title Title
    Main stages Start （Always place at the top）
    Stage1
    Stage2
    Stage3
    Option
    End

    When you "Jump to main stage" from the Title
    It moves to "Start" at the top of the Main stage.
    By rewriting the system variables in "Title"
    and branching the stage transition destination from "Start",
    Stage select can be implement

    (A button = move to the next scene)(X button = move to the ranking)
    The title has the above specifications.
    Edit Stage -> Base Setting -> Disable buttons ON"
    to disable this specification, and you can create your own with a script.

    On the main stage, player is always displayed and pauses are enabled.

    The Option scene does not require the display of player and does not require a pause.
    Disable pause "Edit Stage→Base Settings→Disable pause ON"
    Disable player "Edit Stage→Base Settings→Disable player ON"
