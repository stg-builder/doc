<h2>Relationship between the hit judgment by the physics engine and the normal attack defense judgment.</h2>

<li>Operates as a completely different system</li>
<li>Even if the same size hit points are prepared, only one of them may be hit.</li>
<li>If an attack hit task is made to disappear immediately, it may not be possible to determine the physics calculation.<br>
	To avoid, drop the attack flag in the attack hit task and let it disappear after one frame weighting.<br>
	If the display is turned off at the same time as the attack flag is dropped, the physics calculations will produce a picture with the angle changed by only one frame.<br>

<h2>About Accurate Physical Mode</h2>
<UL>
<li>Normal movement and rotation panels are not available.</li>
<li>Control is done in the script's physics panel</li>
<li>Torque cannot be used together when facing the direction of travel</li>
<li>There may be other glitches.</li>

<h1>Current Constraints</h1>

<UL>
	<li>Children synchronized to the parent's coordinates cannot perform physics operations</li>
	<li>Player options are not physics-capable</li>
	<li>There may be others that can't be done, but unconfirmed.</li>
	<p>
	<li>Characters synchronized with scrolling appear not to be moving, but they are. This can cause vertically stacked characters to collapse.</li>
	<li>It is not possible to assign shapes to the background (placed one by one as characters by hand)</li>
	<p>
	<li>Caving in and slipping through cannot be completely controlled</li>
	<li>Characters may be abnormally fast in rare cases</li>
