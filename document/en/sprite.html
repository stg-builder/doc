            <LI>The pattern number is the number of information from the image that is registered in the pattern list Index number. A serial number is assigned to the leftmost part of the pattern list table, and it is the pattern number (from 1 (Beginning with the beginning and swinging in the positive direction) </LI><BR>
            <LI>Animation number is the number displayed in the animation list (negative direction from -1) </LI><BR>
            Where do you want the animation numbers to go? <BR>
            Essentially, there is a place in the script (in your character or script) where you need to specify a pattern number. So instead of a pattern number, specify an animation number.
            Special pattern number "0 (zero)" <BR>
            If the pattern number is a positive number, the pattern number will be the pattern number and if it is a negative number, it will be the animation. If you set it to 0, the effect is the same as turning off the display. You can also specify the animation. You can also specify a blinking animation in the animation.
